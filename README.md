### ⚡ Problem Statement: Propose an AI based tool that can take a data set, identify patterns in the data, can interpret the result, and can then produce an output story that is understandable to a business user based on the context. System should be able to pro-actively analyse data on behalf of users and generate smart feeds using natural language generation techniques which can then be consumed easily by business users with very less efforts; the story can be told in any combination of plain English supporting visualizations, which however should be kept rather elementary given the intended target user. </i>

## PROJECT EXPLANATION
📌 With the technology advancements, the organisation today has the advantage of taking data driven decisions and create their planning, forecasts based on the same. 

📌 Many business users do not have time to analyze the data and then get insights. And there are gaps between how the tool produces an output and how the business user can use it to interpret it. 

📌 In addition, it needs a good domain knowledge to build business insights from data. Not every user is a business expert. 

📌 Given a snapshot of data, we would like to build a system which can tell a story from the data. 

📌 The story includes the automation in the sense of being driven by the data, context and personal preferences. 

📌 In this case this solves both the problems of the tool usage as well as guiding the user with the data driven intelligence to make business decision. 

📌 The whole result is driven by outcome and effectiveness.

📌The proposed solution is "The Data Demystifier".

        💮The model accepts the dataset as input through a tkinter window,where the user can also set the language in which they prefer to hear the data interpreted story.
        
        💮The data is processed and different types of graphs are generated in order to visualise data.

        💮A voice-over is provided alongside each graph to give a more detailed interpretation about the graph

        💮 At the end of the process,conclusion on the data analysis is provided.

📌  All the vital insights provided from the graph can be stored in a file and then mailed to the organisation for future reference.

### 📈 CONCLUSION
<i>In conclusion, students who completed the test preparation course, whose parents have a master’s degree and the lunch category has a standard value tend to score higher in maths, reading and writing examinations. Thus in education institutions, students should be encouraged to take up the test preparation course. Factors parental education and lunch cannot be changed, but if the student puts in effort by completing the course,he/she will definitely score well.</i>
